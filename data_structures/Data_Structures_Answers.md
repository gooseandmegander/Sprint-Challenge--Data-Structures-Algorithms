For each of the methods associated with each data structure, classify it based on its runtime, using Big O notation.

## Linked List

1. What is the runtime complexity of `addToTail`?
  
    a. What if our list implementation didn't have a reference to the tail of the list in its constructor? What would be the runtime of the `addToTail` method?

2. What is the runtime complexity of `ListNode.insertBefore`?

3. What is the runtime complexity of `ListNode.delete`?

4. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.addToHead`?

5. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.removeFromHead`?

6. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.addToTail`?

7. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.removeFromTail`?

8. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.moveToFront`?

9. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.moveToBack`?

10. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.delete`?

    a. Compare the runtime of the doubly linked list's `delete` method with the worst-case runtime of the `Array.splice` method. Which method generally performs better?

### Doubly Linked List Answers
1. O(1)
2. O(1)
3. O(1)
4. O(1)
5. O(1)
6. O(1)
7. O(1)
8. O(1)
9. O(1)
10. O(1)
10.a. They both perform O(1). I think the Array.splice method would perform better for larger deletions.
