Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.

Exercise I:
(a) - O(1)
(b) - O(log n)
(c) - O(n^3)
(d) - O(n^2)
(e) - O(n^4)
(f) - O(n)
(g) - O(n)

Exercise II:
(a) - The function input is the array of numbers, the function iterates through each number and stores the higher value between the number it is on and the stored previous value, the higher value is retained for the next iteration, the function returns the stored highest value kept.
(b) - Create a function eggDrop that iterates through each 'floor' starting from the bottom, and drops an egg from each floor. If the egg remains unbroken, proceed to the next floor. If the egg breaks after the drop, that floor becomes f.
 
Exercise III:
(a) - The time complexity should be the same since the function will still iterate through the whole array. O(n)
(b) - same as above
